# Linear CLI

A cross-platform CLI for Linear's GraphQL API, with unblocked issue filtering.

Install: `npm install -g @dabble/linear-cli`

## First-Time Setup

```bash
linear login
```

This will:
1. Open Linear API settings in your browser
2. Prompt you to paste your API key
3. Show available teams and let you pick one (or create a new team)
4. Save config to `./.linear`

Use `--global` to save to `~/.linear` instead.

## Configuration

Config is loaded in order: `./.linear` → `~/.linear` → env vars

```
# .linear file format
api_key=lin_api_xxx
team=ISSUE
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Auth
linear login                    # Interactive setup
linear login --global           # Save to ~/.linear
linear logout                   # Remove config
linear whoami                   # Show current user/team

# Issues
linear issues --unblocked       # Ready to work on (no blockers)
linear issues --open            # All non-completed issues
linear issues --in-progress     # Issues currently in progress
linear issues --mine            # Only your assigned issues
linear issues --label bug       # Filter by label
# Flags can be combined: linear issues --in-progress --mine
linear issue show ISSUE-1        # Full details with parent context
linear issue start ISSUE-1       # Assign to you + set In Progress
linear issue create --title "Fix bug" --project "Phase 1" --assign --estimate M
linear issue create --title "Blocked task" --blocked-by ISSUE-1
linear issue update ISSUE-1 --state "In Progress"
linear issue update ISSUE-1 --append "Notes..."
linear issue update ISSUE-1 --blocks ISSUE-2  # Add blocking relation
linear issue close ISSUE-1
linear issue comment ISSUE-1 "Comment text"

# Projects
linear projects                 # Active projects
linear projects --all           # Include completed
linear project show "Phase 1"   # Details with issues
linear project create "Name" --description "..."
linear project complete "Phase 1"

# Labels
linear labels                   # List all labels
linear label create "bug" --color "#FF0000"

# Git
linear branch ISSUE-1            # Create branch: ISSUE-1-issue-title
```

## Estimation

Use t-shirt sizes for estimates. Always use `--estimate` (not `-e`) for clarity.

| Size | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| XS | Trivial, < 1 hour |
| S | Small, couple hours |
| M | Medium, a day or so |
| L | Large, multi-day - consider breaking down |
| XL | Very large - should definitely break down |

```bash
# Create with estimate (use long flags for clarity)
linear issue create --title "Add caching" --estimate M --assign

# L/XL issues should be broken into sub-issues
linear issue create --title "Implement auth" --estimate L
linear issue create --title "Add login endpoint" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
linear issue create --title "Add JWT validation" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
```

## Git Conventions

Always link git work to Linear issues:

```bash
# Create branch from issue (recommended)
linear branch ISSUE-5            # Creates: ISSUE-5-add-caching-layer

# Commit message format
git commit -m "ISSUE-5: Add cache invalidation on logout"

# Include issue ID in PR title
gh pr create --title "ISSUE-5: Add caching layer"
```

## Workflow Guidelines

### Starting work on an issue
```bash
linear issues --unblocked       # Find what's ready
linear issue show ISSUE-2        # Review it (shows parent context)
linear issue start ISSUE-2       # Assign + set In Progress
linear branch ISSUE-2            # Create git branch
```

### When you hit a blocker
If work cannot continue due to a dependency or external factor:

```bash
# Create the blocking issue
linear issue create --title "Need API credentials" --blocks ISSUE-5

# Or mark existing issue as blocking
linear issue update ISSUE-3 --blocks ISSUE-5
```

This removes ISSUE-5 from `--unblocked` results until the blocker is resolved.

### When a task is larger than expected
If you discover an M issue is actually L/XL, break it down:

```bash
# Create sub-issues
linear issue create --title "Step 1: Research approach" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
linear issue create --title "Step 2: Implement core logic" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate M
linear issue create --title "Step 3: Add tests" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S

# Start working on the first sub-issue
linear issue start ISSUE-6
```

### Completing work
After finishing implementation, ask the developer if they want to close the issue:

```bash
# Suggest closing
linear issue close ISSUE-5
```

Do not auto-close issues. Let the developer review the work first.

### Adding notes while working
```bash
linear issue update ISSUE-2 --append "## Notes\n\nDiscovered X, trying Y approach..."
# or for quick updates
linear issue comment ISSUE-2 "Found the root cause in auth.ts:142"
```

### Completing a phase
```bash
linear issue close ISSUE-7       # Close remaining issues
linear project complete "Phase 1"
# Then update CLAUDE.md status table
```

## Parent Context

When viewing an issue with `linear issue show`, you'll see where it fits in the larger work:

```
# ISSUE-6: Add JWT validation

State: In Progress
...

## Context

ISSUE-3: Implement authentication system
  - [Done] ISSUE-4: Add login endpoint
  → [In Progress] ISSUE-6: Add JWT validation  ← you are here
  - [Backlog] ISSUE-7: Add refresh tokens
```

This helps understand the scope and what comes before/after the current task.
